# BaseEducation
BaseEducation is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB/ MoogseDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application designed to help students explore study abroad opportunities, register for preparation classes, read blogs, and counseling appointments with educational advisors. Many students face confusion when preparing to study abroad, BaseEducation simplifies this by centralizing country infomation, services, blogs, and appointments.

# Building a Server, Step-By-Step!

1.  `touch server.js` - create a server.js file
2.  `npm init -y` - command to create package.json and auto populate
3.  change all `server.js` to  `server.mjs` in dir & papckage.json
4.  **optional** Install nodemon locally, if not installed globally `npm i --save-dev nodemon`
5.  Create nodemon start script in package.json `"dev": "nodemon server.js"`
6.  `npm i express` - installs express dependancy to package.json
7. npm i dotenv
